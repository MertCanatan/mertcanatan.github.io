I participated in a [3 Minute Thesis competition](http://graduateschool.ufl.edu/about-us/offices/dgsa/ogio/3mt/) held by my department. I presented and explained my Ph.D. project to a non-technical audience during the competition. [I was thrilled to receive third place in the contest!](https://twitter.com/UF_ABE/status/1582864131304001536)
