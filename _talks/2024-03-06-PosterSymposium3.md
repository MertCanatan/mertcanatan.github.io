I presented research on implementing digital twin technology for refrigerated retail storage systems. The presentation outlined how digital twins can enhance food systems efficiency by creating virtual representations of physical retail storage units. The discussion covered several key aspects: the challenges facing global food systems, the application of digital twin technology for temperature monitoring and inventory management, and methods to reduce energy consumption while maintaining food quality. I also demonstrated how this implementation could help address broader sustainability goals in retail food storage by enabling real-time data analysis and predictive maintenance.
