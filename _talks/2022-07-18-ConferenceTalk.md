During my presentation at ASABE AIM 2022, I shared a method for tracking the temperature of fresh produce stored in a refrigerator. The method I proposed is non-invasive and provides continuous monitoring. It entails using an object detection model in combination with an RGB camera and keeping track of the temperature of a detected object with a thermal IR camera. A single-board computer (Raspberry Pi) is connected to the RGB and IR cameras to achieve this.
