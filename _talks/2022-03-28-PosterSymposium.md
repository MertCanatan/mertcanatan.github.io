<!-- At the poster symposium, I presented a non-invasive and continuous method for tracking the temperature of fresh produce in a refrigerator. The technique involves using an object detection model with an RGB camera and monitoring the temperature of a detected object with a thermal IR camera. This is achieved using RGB and IR cameras connected to a single-board computer (Raspberry Pi). -->
