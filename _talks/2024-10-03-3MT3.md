I presented a framework for implementing digital twins in retail refrigeration systems, highlighting how this technology can address critical challenges in food sustainability. The work demonstrates how digital counterparts of refrigerated display cases can enable real-time optimization, helping reduce the 3.2 trillion pounds of food waste while minimizing energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions in cold chain systems.
