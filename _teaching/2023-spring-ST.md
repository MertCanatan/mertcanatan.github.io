During the Spring 2023 semester, I had the privilege of serving as a supervised teacher for the Land and Water Resources course, which was offered by Dr. [Rafael Mu√±oz-Carpena](https://abe.ufl.edu/faculty/carpena/teaching/index.shtml) at the Agricultural and Biological Engineering Department of the University of Florida.
